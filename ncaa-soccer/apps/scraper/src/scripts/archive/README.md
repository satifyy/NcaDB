# Archived scraper scripts

This folder holds one-off probes, debug helpers, and spot-check scripts (e.g., `debug_*`, `inspect_*`, `verify_*`, `test_*`, `fetch_schedule_table*`). They are excluded from the TypeScript build via `tsconfig.json` and are not maintained. Run them ad hoc with `ts-node`/`node` only if you need to resurrect old debugging flows.
